## Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Microcontroller board compatible with Arduino IDE and Servo.h module
  - Code has been tested and is compatible with Arduino Zero and Arduino Uno
- Two continuous servo motors
- One 180° limited servo motor
- Breadboard



## Features
- "Smart Direction" decision making
- Distance pinging using HC-SR04
- Driver board *not* required

#### Decision Making Structure
```python
ASSUME: diff = distance left of car - distance right of car
        note: distance refers to distance of closest object detected by HC-SR04 sensor

Object Detected!
Look Left and Right.
  ├── if distance ahead < absolute value of diff:
  │   └── Move Backward
  │
  ├── if absolute value of diff < 5 cm:
  │   └── Move Backward
  │
  ├── if diff < 0:
  │   └── Move Backward
  │       └── Move Right
  ├── else:
  │   └── Move Backward
  │       └── Move Left
  └── Loop
```
